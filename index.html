<h2>Self-introduction </h2>
<hr />
I am an Associate Professor and the Vice Dean of Department of Computer Science, at <A HREF="http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/">College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering</A>, <A HREF="http://www.hnu.edu.cn/">Hunan University</A>. 
<br />
<br />
Before I became a professor, I worked at <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia</A> as an Associate Researcher, from 2016-2018. During my years at MSRA (started from 2014 as a research intern), I was lucky to work closely with many great researchers such as <A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kun-tan-7993b114/">Kun Tan</A> from Wireless & Networking Group,  <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/moscitho/">Thomas Moscibroda</A> from Cloud & Mobile Group, <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lidongz/">Lidong Zhou</A> from System Group, and <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yqx/">Yongqiang Xiong</A> from Networking Group.
<br />
I got my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at <A HREF="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/index.html">Tsinghua University</A>, working with <A HREF="http://netman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~peidan/">Dan Pei</A> and <A HREF="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224200728346539633/20101224200728346539633_.html">Youjian Zhao</A>. I did my undergrad at <A HREF="http://en.whu.edu.cn">Wuhan University</A>.
<br />
<br />
My Chinese version self-introduction is available on our school's site. Find it <A HREF="http://jobs.hnu.edu.cn/info/1120/1710.htm">here</A>.

<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<hr />
My research interests lie broadly in computer networking and networked system, with a special focus on <b>cloud networking</b> for now. If you have no idea about the cloud networking, you may refer to my <A HREF="Courses/CloudComputing2018Spring.html">course materials</A> (prepared for senior undergraduate students) which overview the current hottest cloud networking research topics. I also do research on <b>AI system</b>.
<br />
<br />
<font size="4" color="red">
<b>
I'm always looking for hard-working and self-motivated PhD/master/intern students who are interested in networking and system research. 
</b>
</font>
</p>

<p> 
<h2>Non-research Interest</h2>
<hr />
I love to play volleyball. I served as the captain of Tsinghua University volleyball team, which won the silver medal twice in Beijing University Volleyball League in 2015 and 2014.
<br />
